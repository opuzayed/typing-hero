        <h2>Q2 : Difference between local storage vs session storage?</h2>
        <h3>Local Storage</h3>
        <p>It is a web storage method that helps us store data on the client’s computer in the form of key/value pairs in a web browser. The data is stored in local storage for a lifetime unless the user manually deletes it from the browser. It does not expire even when the user closes the window or tab. Instead, the data remains in the browser until and unless the browser's memory is cleared.
</p>
<p>It's data in the browser can only be accessed via JavaScript and HTML5. However, the user also could clear the browser data/cache to erase all local storage data. It has four methods that we can use to set, retrieve, remove and clear:</p>
<ul>
    <li>We can use the setItem() method to set the data in local storage. This method takes two parameters, i.e., key and value. With this method, we can store value with a key. localStorage.setItem(key, value);</li>
    <li>The data stored in it has no expiration date</li>
    <li>The storage limit is about 10MB</li>
    <li>Its data is never transferred to the server</li>
</ul>
<h3>Session Storage</h3>
<p>It is very similar to the local storage. Still, the main difference lies in the lifespan as it persists in the browser until its current tab is on. Once you close the tab or terminate it, the data on session storage also gets lost. We can also set and retrieve its data using setItem() and getItem() methods, respectively, similar to the local storage methods.</p>

        <h2>Q2 : Difference between global scope vs block scope in javascript?</h2>
        <h3>Global Scope:</h3>
        <p>The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are known as global variables and have global scope. Global scope means that the variables can be accessed from any part of that program, any function or conditional state can access that variable.</p>
        <h3>Block Scope</h3>
        <p>Block scope is also a sub-type of local scope. The block scope can be defined as the scope of the variables inside the curly brackets {}. Now, these curly brackets can be of loops, or conditional statements, or something else. You are only allowed to refer to these variables from within the curly brackets {}.</p>

        <h2> Q3 : How event loop works in javascript?</h2>
        <p>The Event Loop has one simple job — to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.</p>

        <h2>Q4:Ways to get undefined in javascript?</h2>
        <h3>Eight ways to get undefined in javascript.</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Variable that is not initialized will give undefined</li>
            <li>Function with no return </li>
            <li>Parameter that is not passed will be undefined</li>
            <li>If return has nothing on the right side will return undefined</li>
            <li>Property that doesn't exists on an object will give you undefined</li>
            <li>Accessing array elements outside of the index range </li>
            <li>Deleting an element inside an array</li>
            <li>Set a value directly to undefined</li>
        </ol>
